  Passing a non-directory won't raise an error or anything, it'll just yield

    #   code, though)

    # * Moving a watched directory within a watched directory will get the
    #   wrong path.  This needs to use the cookie system to link events
    #   together and complete the move properly, which can still make some
    #   events get the wrong path if you get file events during the move or
    #   something silly like that, since MOVED_FROM and MOVED_TO aren't
    #   guaranteed to be contiguous.  That exercise is left up to the
    #   reader.
    #
    # * Trying to watch a path that doesn't exist won't automatically
    #   create it or anything of the sort.
    #
    # * Deleting and recreating or moving the watched directory won't do
    #   anything special, but it probably should.
