# Mask.ACCESS would notify on any read/execs
# Mask.ATTRIB would notify on changes to timestamps, permissions, user/group ID
# Mask.CLOSE would notify on files being closed (after being opened?)
# Mask.OPEN would notify on files being opened
# Mask.UNMOUNT would notify on a file system being unmounted

    #   create it or anything of the sort.
